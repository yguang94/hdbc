                            <p>
                                The purpose of customer due diligence is to prevent the use of assets and property
                                obtained in a criminal manner in the economic activities of credit institutions and
                                financial institutions and in the services provided by them whose goal is to prevent the
                                exploitation of the financial system and economic space of the Republic of Estonia for
                                money laundering and terrorist financing. Customer due diligence is aimed, first and
                                foremost, at applying the Know-Your-Customer principle, under which a customer shall be
                                identified and the appropriateness of transactions shall be assessed based on the
                                customer’s principal business and prior pattern of payments. In addition, customer due
                                diligence serves to identify unusual circumstances in the operations of a customer or
                                circumstances whereby an employee of the Company has reason to suspect money laundering
                                or terrorist financing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Requirement for the measures of prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing
                                is that the Company does not enter into transactions or establish relationships with
                                anonymous or unidentified persons. Legislation requires that the Company waives a
                                transaction or the establishment of a business relationship if a person fails to provide
                                sufficient information to identify the person or about the purpose of the transactions
                                or if the operations of the person involve a higher risk of money laundering or
                                terrorist financing. Also, legislation requires the Company to terminate a continuing
                                contract without the advance notification term if the person fails to submit sufficient
                                information for application of customer due diligence measures.
                            </p>
                            <p>
