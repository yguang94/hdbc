                                We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system
                                can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information,
                                we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches,
                                or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how
                                they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal
                                information through insecure email.
